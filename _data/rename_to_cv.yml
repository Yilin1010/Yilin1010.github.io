    - title: "AI Safety Research: Model Unlearning in Deep Learning"
      year: Present
      description:
        - Model unlearning is to remove specific subset of data from large models, cheaper and faster than retraining the model, to preserve privacy and compliance.
        - Studied research and techniques of AI safety, Adversarial Robustness, Red Teaming, Sparse auto-encoder.
        - Formulated unlearning problem and criteria. Designed Unlearning methods and experiments on CNN and Transformer models.
        - Analyzed Forgetting Quality and efficiency. Wrote formulation and experiments for paper.
    - title: "Computer Vision: Real-Time System (OpenCV, C++, PyTorch)"
      year: Spring 2024
      description:
        - Develop a framework of Pruning, fine-tune efficient Vision Transformer models (ViT).
        - Chinese character object recognition system, with cleanup, segmentation, region-analysis pipelines.
        - Created AR objects, Cartooned face video filter, real-time speed optimization by Parallel Processing.
