### Three Parts of My Experiences and How They Connect

#### **Three Parts of My Experience**

I’d like to break down how my experiences and skills connect to this role in three main areas: **AI safety research, software engineering practices, and user-centric design**

**AI SafeWty Research:** AI safety is a significant focus of my experience. From 4 years ago, I started reading papers and blogs in this field, I’ve been familiar with reproducing methods and customizing features for related AI algorithms.

**Software Engineering Practices**: I have a bachelor’s in software engineering, where I learned agile techniques. Later, I took a graduate course taught by a principal software engineer from Microsoft, and that’s where I got a lot of hands-on experience writing production-level code.

**User Centric Design**: I took a graduate-level HCI course taught by a former senior HCI scientist from Allen Institute for AI(AI2). My motivation for studying HCI stems from my curiosity about how large LLMs will transform human interact with devices. I wanted understand it better. This course has provided me with a structured HCI perspective. 
For our project, my team did user research and made a few small adjustments to ChatGPT’s website to improve trust and easier to use.”

#### **How These Experiences Connecting?**

My experience might seem broad, and someone maybe wonder it lacks focus. But after working on different projects, I realized that I’m really interested in one core idea: making practical adjustment to current solutions that improve user experience. 

My motivation comes from wanting to make users more satisfied than they are now.

I think we don’t always have to completely reinvent solutions, I think it's important to understand target users and the limitations of current methods before doing research or develop a products. So that we can make meaningful improvements without without having to replace everything that’s already working.
